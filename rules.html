            <h2>Setting Up</h2>
            <p>In the setup of the game, you have the option to select the number of players, the number of skips each player gets, as well as the game mode.
            The two game modes are 'Classic', and 'Family'.  Family mode pulls from a set of dares that are more kid friendly, and dares
            you could probably do around your grandma.  </p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The game consists of players taking turns choosing from 3 "dare guns" to fire.  If the gun "fires", you have to do the dare presented to you
            (or you can skip...if you're into that).  If the gun "clicks", then you're off the hook, and it's the next players turn.  After the gun "clicks", or the player completes the dare, press "Completed" to reload for the next person's turn.  The game ends whenever the group decides to stop playing, so you can keep playing for as long as you want.</p>
            <h2>Skips</h2>
            <p>Each player gets a predetermined number of skips (set in the settings).  If you don't like the dare you got, press the skip button and it'll
            be the next persons turn.  </p>
